"----------- Syntastic with  pylint ------------"
" https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic
" Use :SyntasticCheck to manually check right now. Use :Errors to open the
" location-list window, and :lclose to close it. You can clear the error
" list with :SyntasticReset, and you can use :SyntasticToggleMode to switch
" between active (checking on writing the buffer) and passive (manual) checking.
  
" You don't have to switch focus to the location-list window to jump to the
" different errors. Vim provides several built-in commands for this, for
" example :lnext and :lprevious. You may want to add shortcut mappings for
" these commands, or perhaps install a plugin such as Tim Pope's unimpaired
" (see https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired) that provides such mappings.
